# Contineo Scraper

Contineo requires the input of PRN (or roll number) and DoB on every login, which can be inconvenient.

This application allows the user to register once with their **_PRN_** (or **_roll number_**), **_DoB_**, and a **_username_**.

After registration, the user **only** needs to enter the **_username_** to automatically fill in their PRN and DoB on the Contineo
site, making it easier to access the attendance and marks.

## Features
- Register with PRN, DoB, and a username.
- Retrieve attendance and marks using just the username.
- Shows the **_number of lectures to attend_** more to reach the _75% attendance threshold_.
