To log into contineo we need to input our prn, dob which is annoying when you have to do it everytime.
So here you basically register with your prn and dob once along with a username(that you will use to get your data).
After registering you just have to enter the username and your prn and dob will automatically be filled in the actual contineo site and the results will be displayed here(attendance and marks).
